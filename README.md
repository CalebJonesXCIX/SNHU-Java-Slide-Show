# SNHU-Java-Slide-Show
University Project to create a slideshow in Java about travel destinations

Included in this repository is a document (CS250 7-1 Final Project Submission.docx) outlining my role in a hypothetical SCRUM team. In order to interpret user needs and implement them into a program the user need has to be converted into a user story. This user story will help if they are built with clear acceptance criterias. This way the program can be tested to ensure the user needs are implemented successfully. I approach developing programs very closely to the scrum and agile approach. Even in terms of a small scale project, it benefits from breaking the components down and working on each portion incrementally. Also it is important to allow for time to test, debug, iterate and refactor if needed. I hope to include more agile processes like “retrospectives” into my development career moving forward. Development is also heavily team focused. A good team member is respectful and understanding. They are helpful and punctual. A team member should be someone you could call a friend and you should aim to be that for others as well.
